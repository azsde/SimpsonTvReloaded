# SimpsonTvReloaded

Hello and welcome to the SimpsonTvReloaded guide ðŸ™‚

The original idea is from [Brandon Withrow](https://github.com/buba447) and you can find his original build guide [here](https://withrow.io/simpsons-tv-build-guide-waveshare).

While the original idea was already awesome (ðŸ˜Ž), I wanted to bring some changes and improvements:

 - Software:
	 - Gapless Playback using VLC (instead of the abandonned and deprecated OmxPlayer)
	 - Playback control (play/pause, next, previous)
 - Hardware:
	 - Audio filter for the audio over GPIO
	 - LiPo Battery added for a wireless experience
 - 3D Model
	 - VCR with functional buttons (used for playback)
	 - Back panel access (sturdier and no more visible seam)
	 - Front screen bezel adjusted to not cover the LCD screen
